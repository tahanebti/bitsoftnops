## Technologies used
[Spring Cloud Stream](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/current/reference/html/) : to build highly scalable event-driven applications connected with shared messaging systems; <br>
[Spring Cloud Schema Registry](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-schema-registry/current/reference/html/spring-cloud-schema-registry.htm) : that supports schema evolution so that the data can be evolved over time; besides, it lets you store schema information in a textual format (typically JSON) and makes that information accessible to various applications that need it to receive and send data in binary format; <br>
[Spring Data Elasticsearch](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/elasticsearch/docs/current/reference/html) : to persist data in elasticsearch
